Introduction
============

Seele blockchain is based on the Neural Consensus protocol, which
consists of a mainchain and subchains to form a heterogeneous forest
multi-chain ecosystem when fully developed. (https://seele.pro)

The current mainnet release: Seele mainchain is powered by a new
memory-consuming consensus PoW algorithm, which records intermediate
hash strings. [(SPOW PAPER)]
(https://medium.com/@SeeleTech/the-seele-pow-consensus-algorithm-7f99495b500f)
The mainchain has four shards. It can perform transactions within a
shard or crossing shards. However, smart contracts currently can be only
executed within the same shard. Seele subchains are under development.
The so called EDA consensus algorithm `(EDA
PAPER) <http://seele.hk.ufileos.com/Seele_Yellow_Paper_EDA_A_Parallel_Data_Sorting_Mechanism_for_Distributed_Information_Processing_System_Pre-Release.pdf>`__
from Seele will be utilized for the subchains.
