How To Build Your Own Seele Network
===================================

Steps to build your own seele-network
-------------------------------------

Refer to `Getting Started With
Seele <Getting-Started-With-Seele.html>`__ to start a single node

-  If you need to start one or multiple nodes to form a network，modify
   the list in the staticNodes field found in the file nodes1.json under
   ``go-seele\cmd\node\config``. The format for the staticNodes address
   is of the form “ip:port”. To add one or more addresses, use
   ”staticNodes”:[“ip:port”,…]，where ip address is the ip of the
   servers in the cluster. Do not add your own machine address as it
   will be invalid. The addresses must be the nodes within the cluster.
   Refer to pic1 and pic2.

   "p2p": {
       "privateKey":"0xf65e40c6809643b25ce4df33153da2f3338876f181f83d2281c6ac4a987b1479",
       "staticNodes": [],
       "address": "0.0.0.0:8057",
       "networkID": 1
     }


     "p2p": {
       "privateKey":"0xf65e40c6809643b25ce4df33153da2f3338876f181f83d2281c6ac4a987b1479",
       "staticNodes": ["ip:8057","ip1:8057"],
       "address": "0.0.0.0:8057",
       "networkID": 1
     }

-  The coinbase, privateKey, and shard are in matching pairs on each
   node in the cluster. Each node’s coinbase, privateKey, and shard can
   be generated by running the ``go build`` command under
   ``github.com\seeleteam\go-seele\cmd\client``\ ，then running
   ``.\client key --shard 1``\ （Linux and mac） or
   ``.\client.exe key --shard 1`` (windows), where shard is the
   designated shard, This shard could be the shard of the node address
   or the shard of the user address. The result should look like the
   following:

::

   public key:  0xf5a6264d9b50af8ea9575b06c56a8f8b890ed051
   private key: 0xe5f1566a2dc7325c8a906f361864162d4f29d1c4c06af749f1fd513577c97c2d

-  Enter the corresponding public key information for coinbase，enter
   the privateKey information for private key，and enter the shard
   information for the shard field

::

   "basic":{
       "name": "seele node1",
       "version": "1.0",
       "dataDir": "node1",
       "address": "0.0.0.0:8027",
       "coinbase": "0x4c10f2cd2159bb432094e3be7e17904c2b4aeb21"
     },
     "p2p": {
   "privateKey":"0xf65e40c6809643b25ce4df33153da2f3338876f181f83d2281c6ac4a987b1479",
       "staticNodes": [],
       "address": "0.0.0.0:8057",
       "networkID": 1
     },

   "genesis": {
       "difficult":8000000,
       "shard":1
     }

When modifications are complete, the nodes will form a cluster when
started(\ `Getting Started With
Seele <Getting-Started-With-Seele.html>`__).
